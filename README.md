# Graph Coloring Application

This is a Python application that allows users to draw vertices on a canvas, connect them with edges, and color the graph using Brooks' Coloring Algorithm. The application uses the `tkinter` library for the graphical user interface.

## Features

- Draw vertices on a canvas by clicking with the mouse.
- Connect vertices by selecting them on the canvas.
- Clear the graph by removing all vertices and edges.
- Color the graph using Brooks' Coloring Algorithm.
- Display the graph's chromatic coloring number and maximum degree.
- The vertices are represented as circles on the canvas, and their colors are displayed as numbers inside the circles.

## Installation

1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository or download the `graph_coloring.py` file.

## Usage

1. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the `graph_coloring.py` file is located.
2. Run the following command to start the application:

```bash```
python graph_coloring.py

3. The application window will appear.
4. Click on the canvas to add vertices.
5. Click the "Connect Vertices" button to activate the connect mode and connect the vertices by selecting them.
6. Use the "Clear Graph" button to remove all vertices and edges.
7. Click the "Color Graph" button to apply Brooks' Coloring Algorithm and color the graph.
8. Use the "Graph Information" button to display the chromatic coloring number and maximum degree of the graph.
